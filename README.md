Last Updated: 10/15/2015


IMPORTANT: This GitHub repo/wiki will no longer be updated. All contents will remain frozen. All new Iso-Seq information, including SMRTLink 4.0 and above, tutorials, etc, will be now maintained at the new [Iso-Seq "IsoSeq_SA3nUp" repository](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq_SA3nUP/wiki). Many of the links are now actually pointing to the new repo.


**IMPORTANT NOTICE: The current version (2.2.3) of ToFU will NOT BE UPDATED. The next round of ToFu will be expected to be released after November 2015, after changes conforming to [PacBio's new BAM format standard](https://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/pacbio-unveils-plans-use-bam-format-sequence-data-user-community-weighs) have been completed. All bugs and issues in ToFU 2.2.3 can be reported but will not be fixed until after the format changes.**


## Latest News

Current ToFU version: v2.2.3 (see [CHANGES](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki/cDNA_primer-tofu-CHANGELOG))

The scripts in this repository are now compatible with SMRTAnalysis 2.3. It is a "beta" version of the RS_IsoSeq protocol that is supported in 2.3, meaning that it extends the existing RS_IsoSeq code base, and is an unofficial, developemental version of RS_IsoSeq. This beta version is only accessible via command line. The command line name of the official RS_IsoSeq is *pbtranscript*, to differentiate from the official version, in the tutorials we will refer to the beta version provided on this site as *pbtranscript-tofu*. 

Functionalities provided in *pbtranscript-tofu* are highly developmental and may not make it into the next version of official RS_IsoSeq.


## About This Repository

The scripts in this repository is developed for the purpose of analyzing transcriptome data generated using the PacBio(R) [Iso-Seq(TM) protocol](http://www.smrtcommunity.com/Share/Protocol?id=a1q70000000HqSvAAK&strRecordTypeName=Protocol). 


This code is not part of the official PacBio software package and is developed solely by Elizabeth Tseng. The official software version is the RS_IsoSeq protocol. Use this code at your own risk.


## About Iso-Seq(TM)

The Iso-Seq (Isoform Sequencing) protocol refers to PacBio’s proprietary methods and applications for transcriptome sequencing. Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/cDNA_primer/wiki) for more information.
